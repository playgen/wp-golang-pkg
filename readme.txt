Allows you to import your go packages via your site's URL

== Description ==
This sets up a proxy for `go get` so that your packages are branded with your
 site's name. This also allows you to store your packages somewhere that isn't
 one of the 'approved' code stores (eg Gooogle Code, GitHub, Bitbucket
 or Launchpad) either privately or publicly.
